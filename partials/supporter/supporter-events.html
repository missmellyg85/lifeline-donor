			<p>The Walk for Life is a great fundraiser for the entire family!  You can walk as an individual or as a team of 4.  Walkers raise pledges from family and friends prior to the event in support of their commitment to join us and walk two miles the day of the Walk.  All proceeds raised go directly to support the free services Lifeline provides.</p>
